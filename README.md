# NEXUS GENESIS ENGINE (v1.0.4)
# ==============================================================================

Nexus is an infrastructure coordination system for deterministic state validation.
It implements CPU-first phasing with memristor threshold epochs for secure and
causally-consistent operations.

## Purpose
Nexus provides a canonical reference for systems requiring irreversible and 
causally-consistent state validation. It is designed to be the authoritative 
validation source, supporting auditability and controlled operational integration.

## Key Features
- CPU-first deterministic infrastructure coordination
- Phasing to memristor threshold epochs for secure, verifiable operations
- Audit-ready source code for research and compliance purposes
- Certified APIs for operational dependency integration
- Immutable authoritative reference point for state validation

## Usage
Authorized third parties may:
- Audit the source code in read-only mode for research, compliance, or transparency
- Integrate via official Nexus APIs under controlled license agreements

Unauthorized use, replication, or modification outside these terms is prohibited.
